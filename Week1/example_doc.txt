Chapter 1 The Fence
Tom Sawyer lived with his aunt because his mother and
father were dead. Tom didn’t like going to school, and he
didn’t like working. He liked playing and having
adventures. One Friday, he didn’t go to school—he went
to the river.
Aunt Polly was angry. “You’re a bad boy!” she said.
“Tomorrow you can’t play with your friends because you
didn’t go to school today. Tomorrow you’re going to work
for me. You can paint the fence.”
Saturday morning, Tom was not happy, but he started to
paint the fence. His friend Jim was in the street.
Tom asked him, “Do you want to paint?”
Jim said, “No, I can’t. I’m going to get water.”
Then Ben came to Tom’s house. He watched Tom and
said, “I’m going to swim today. You can’t swim because
you’re working.”
Tom said, “This isn’t work. I like painting.”
“Can I paint, too?” Ben asked.
“No, you can’t,” Tom answered. “Aunt Polly asked me
because I’m a very good painter.”
Ben said, “I’m a good painter, too. Please, can I paint? I
have some fruit. Do you want it?”
OK,” Tom said. “Give me the fruit. Then you can paint.”
Ben started to paint the fence. Later, many boys came to
Tom’s house. They watched Ben, and they wanted to
paint, too.
Tom said, “Give me some food and you can paint.” 
Tom stayed in the yard, and the boys painted. They
painted the fence three times. It was beautiful and white.
Tom went into the house. “Aunt Polly, can I play now?”
he asked.
Aunt Polly was surprised. “Did you paint the fence?”
she asked.
“Yes, I did,” Tom answered.
Aunt Polly went to the yard and looked at the fence. She
was very surprised and very happy. “It’s beautiful!” she
said. “Yes, you can play now.”
Tom walked to his friend Joe Harper’s house and played
with his friends there. Then he walked home again. There
was a new girl in one yard. She had yellow hair and blue
eyes. She was beautiful. Tom wanted to talk to her, but she
didn’t see him. She went into her house. Tom waited, but
she didn’t come out again.
